Joulie is a lightweight, browser-based rune selector: it lets you browse and search a set of runes, choose them in sequence (including inverted variants when applicable), and instantly produces a clean, copy-ready list of your selection. It’s designed for quick divination spreads and note-taking, with simple selection management (remove/undo) and automatic saving so your last pick is preserved.
